We begin to build our application UI and connect it to the simulation engine. 

* To let it run on Windows, you need to install:

    - Python 3
    
    - Django 1.10.x
    
    - django-debug-toolbar
  
* How to use it:

  Clone the whole project to the local for the first time. 

  Under the `pathToProjectFolder/mysite`, run command:
  
    ```
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```
