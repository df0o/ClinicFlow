I made some simple validation for inputs of our front end.
The js folder contains the javascriptfile for validation, and this folder should be located under static folder.

I changed passport.html, setting.html, singlechedule.html under template folder. 
I fixed some errors.

I modified a little bit in views to prevent the duplicated submit after refreshing under clinicflow folder. 

I modified urls.py from mysite folder.
I think the schedule page is duplicate with singleschedule. Thus I remove it from our url and make schedulelist as dashboard
