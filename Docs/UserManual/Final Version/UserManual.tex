\section{Introduction}

\subsection{What is ClinicFlow?}
ClinicFlow is a tool which allows clinics to: keep a record of patient activity data, generate statistics on past data, and simulate clinic environments to predict future performance. \\

\subsection{Objective of User Manual}
This manual provides an overview and guide for the core functionalities included in this product. If you have not yet created an account, please refer to section 4. \\
For all other inqueries, please refer to section 6. Troubleshooting. If this guide does not answer your questions, feel free to contact us: Section 6.2

\subsection{Background}
This tool was first developed for use at the Joseph Brant Hospital pre-operative clinic. Its functionality has since been expanded to allow the  changing of clinic properties, including staff, procedures, and addition of  constraints. \\ It was initially intended to be able to generate the schedules for the clinics, but this feature was abandoned during development for being too difficult to implement during the time allotted of the project. \\

\subsection{Roadmap}
We hope to allow this product to be implemented in any clinic environment. To do this, we have taken steps to abstract away the specific clinic we are dealing with, instead opting for a variable clinic model which can be adapted to the specific clinic using this product.

\section{Schedules}
\subsection{Schedule}
Upon logging in, the user will be presented the schedules selection screen. From here they can either select the schedule they wish to use, or create a new schedule.\\

If no schedule is associated with this account, one must be created (See 5.1.1)\\

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Viewing all previously created schedules}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Create Schedule}
To use this application, a schedule must be created it's constraints set up.\\
To create a schedule, one must be on the "Previous Schedules screen" (See figure 3)\\

To create a schedule:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Click the "Create Schedule" button
\item Enter the available providers
\item Enter schedule date
\item Go back to the Previous Schedules screen and select your newly created schedule
\item Click into the schedule to add patients and generate simulations
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sim}
\caption{Adding patients to the schedule}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Overview}
This screen will show statistic about the current status of the clinic based on actual passport data.\\

Note: Passport data must be set up in order to use this screen (See 5.3)

\subsubsection{Select Date Range}
The selects the time range for which statistics will be calculated.\\
In order to change:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Click on the arrow beside the date at the top
\item Select the FROM date on the left
\item Select the TO date on the right
\item Click apply to filter the passport data to within that range
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{passport}
\caption{Overview of Clinic}
\end{figure}

\subsection{New Passport}
This section allow the user to add new passports. This data is used to provide summary statistics of the clinic environment, as well as help build a model of the clinic for simulation purposes. \\ \newline
Note: In order to add new passport, the schedule must have a set of constraints associated with it (See 5.5) \\
To add a passport:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Click the "Add New Passport" button
\item Enter the passport information, including reason for visit, scheduled arrival time, and required procedures
\item Click "Add Passport"
\end{enumerate}

To remove a patient:

If no schedule/rule set has been created, the user must create one first (See 5.4.2) \\

\subsubsection{Simulation Selection}
This screen shows a list of stored simulation models. \\

To select a simulation, click on the name of simulation.

\subsubsection{Create Model}
This function allow the user to create a new simulation model. This is required in order to run simulations. \\
